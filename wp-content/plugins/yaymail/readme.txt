This WooCommerce email customizer provides a live preview editor so that you can see quickly how every adjustment turns out when published.

With YayMail, you can drag and drop elements to the email template builder. Each element makes a block in the WooCommerce email template and is very easy to edit content, style, and other appearances. 

Changing the email layout is also very simple as you can move up/down and copy blocks anytime you want.

###‚ö°Ô∏è FEATURES

**Smart Email Customisation Elements**
Basic and advanced elements are thoughtfully categorized for you to easily pick and nicely show in your email. All elements and blocks work smoothly and seamlessly.
